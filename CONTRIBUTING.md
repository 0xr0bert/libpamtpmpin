Contributions are welcome!

Please open a pull request (PR) with your proposed changes. For larger or breaking changes, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach.

Include tests where appropriate and follow the existing code style. All contributions will be reviewed and may receive feedback.

Please format code using clang-format with the included .clang-format style (e.g. run `clang-format -i <files>` or enable your editor's clang-format integration) before opening a PR.
